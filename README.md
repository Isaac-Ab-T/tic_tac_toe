# tic_tac_toe
This is my first project updated to GITHUB.

A simple game created within PYTHON and modified with a GUI TKINTER. The algorithm in game can host a 3X3 block to an infinte block but has only been reduced to a 3X3 block due to reasons of limiting widgets. Each block is a Tkinter button that changes its color and text according to the Player that clicks the button. The button is disabled when a valid click by the designated player is performed and disabled at the end of each round.
